# Banana Split üçå

Banana Split is a [Bangle.js 2](https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js2) app that has been developed to test the practicality of a banana storage container, while additionally tracking overall banana consumption.

## Context

I eat a lot of bananas. Playing off this, my partner bought me a banana 'storage container' as a bit of a laugh.

Looking at the container, one of my first thoughts was _"bananas don't have a consistent shape, how many bananas will actually fit in this?"_. This thought is what spawned the `Banana Split` concept - an app that will be used to record whether a banana 'fits' or 'splits' the container for every banana that I eat in 2022. Stay posted for the [results](https://github.com/Johoseph/banana-split#results) which I will update throughout the year üòé

## App usage

If you want to try the app for yourself, you can go to my forked [Bangle Apps](https://johoseph.github.io/BangleApps/#banana%20split) site to download it directly or try it via the [Espruino IDE emulator](https://www.espruino.com/ide/). The following interaction paradigms can be used to navigate through Banana Split:

- **SWIPE** left and right to view different interface screens.
- **PRESS** the side **BUTTON** to navigate to a weekly graph view of banana consumption.
- **TAP** the **TOP** watch _once_ to add a banana that **does not** fit in the container. **TAP** the **TOP** watch _twice_ to add a banana that **does** fit in the container (unavailable via emulator).
- **TAP** the **BOTTOM** of the watch _once_ or _twice_ (as above) to remove bananas that have accidentally been added (unavailable via emulator).
- **TWIST** the watch to shower bananas across the screen! (unavailable via emulator)
